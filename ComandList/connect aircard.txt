How to make the air card work.
If the aircard is still plugged in, pull it out first. Then install.

sudo apt install modemmanager modem-manager-gui network-manager network-manager-gnome

Then plug in the aircard, wait a moment, ModemManager will detect the modem itself.

mmcli -L $ See if you have found the modem.

nmcli $ view connection status

To create a connection profile to connect to the mobile operator.
An example would be a connection with True, with the APN set to internet only.

sudo nmcli c add con-name "mycon" type gsm ifname "*" apn "internet"  $ The name of the connection is mycon

sudo nmcli nmcli c mod mycon connection.autoconnect yes

A new route will be created automatically, you can connect and disconnect.

sudo nmcli c up mycon

sudo nmcli c down mycon
