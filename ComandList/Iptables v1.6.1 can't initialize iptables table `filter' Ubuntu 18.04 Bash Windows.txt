I need to open some port with:

sudo ufw 171.96.0.25 to any port 5631 $ or sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

But I get the following error:

ERROR: initcaps
[Errno 2] iptables v1.6.1: can't initialize iptables table `filter': Table does not exist (do you need to insmod?)
Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.

I get the same error by typing:

iptables -L



I've already upgrade my kernel with :

sudo apt install update-manager
