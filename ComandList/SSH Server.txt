Configuring Firewall

By default, Xrdp listens on port 3389 on all interfaces. If you run a firewall on your Ubuntu server (which you should always do), youâ€™ll need to add a rule that will enable traffic on the Xrdp port.
To allow access to the Xrdp server from a specific IP address or IP range, in this example 192.168.1.0/24, run the following command:

sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 3389 $ Remote Desktop Protocol from anywhere to device
